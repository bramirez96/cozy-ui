# Theming

This folder contains things like mixins and variables that can be used and overridden to theme the component library according to your needs. The following are a list of theme variables that were added in as easy levers for some of the easier and more common overrides you might need:
- `@cozy-border-radius`
- `@cozy-shadow-color`
- `TBD`

> Fair warning that changing certain theme variables could result in some unexpected results and may require a good amount of tweaking to maintain a cohesive style.
